🌾: mid-point:
            You notice the sweet treats and ingrdients all around you. Suddenly you hear your boss shouting 'Grab these ingredients in 15 minutes or say goodby to your job!!' and he throws down an ingredient list.

🍄:end
            The game starts and now you have 5minutes(in game) to gather 5-10 ingredients. If you succed your boss will begrudingly thank you. If you fail you either get eaten by a cake monster or your boss yells you if you make it back
